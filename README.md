## Description

`udio_wrapper` is a Python package that allows you to generate music tracks from Udio's API using textual prompts. This package is designed to interact with Udio's API and is not officially endorsed by Udio.

## Advantages Over Other Models

Unlike other music generation models, Udio offers a unique feature of extending or conditioning new tracks based on existing ones, making it ideal for iterative and creative music production processes.

### Usage

To use `udio_wrapper`, import the `UdioWrapper` class and provide the necessary parameters.

## Usage Examples

The following examples demonstrate various ways to use the `UdioWrapper` to generate music based on different scenarios:

```python
auth_token = "your-auth-token-here"  # Replace this with your actual authentication token
udio_wrapper = UdioWrapper(auth_token)
```

1. Creating a Short Song
You can specify the prompt, seed, custom lyrics.
```python

short_song_no_download = udio_wrapper.create_song(
    prompt="Relaxing jazz and soulful music",
    seed=-1,
    custom_lyrics="Short song lyrics here"
)
print("Short song generated without downloading:", short_song_no_download)
```
2. Extending a Song
Extend a previously created song by providing its path and ID for conditioning. This method also allows for lyric customization.
```python

extend_song_download = udio_wrapper.extend(
    prompt="A dynamic version of relaxing jazz and soulful music",
    seed=-1,
    audio_conditioning_path="url-generated-song",
    audio_conditioning_song_id="previous-song-id",
    custom_lyrics="Extended version lyrics"
)
print("Extended song generated and downloaded:", extend_song_download)
```

3. Adding an Outro
Generate an outro for your music sequence using the last song as a base. This includes custom lyrics.
```python

outro_song_download = udio_wrapper.add_outro(
    prompt="A smooth ending to our jazz session",
    seed=-1,
    audio_conditioning_path="url-generated-song",
    audio_conditioning_song_id="last-extended-song-id",
    custom_lyrics="Outro lyrics here"
)
print("Outro song generated and downloaded:", outro_song_download)
```

4. Creating a Complete Song Sequence
Generate a full sequence of songs, including multiple extensions and an outro. This process involves defining prompts and lyrics for each part of the sequence.
```python
complete_song_sequence = udio_wrapper.create_complete_song(
    short_prompt="On a full moon night",
    extend_prompts=["the soft sound of the saxophone fills the air", "creating an atmosphere of mystery and romance"],
    outro_prompt="Thus ends this melody, leaving an echo of emotions in the heart",
    num_extensions=2,
    custom_lyrics_short="Short song lyrics here",
    custom_lyrics_extend=["Lyrics for first extension", "Lyrics for second extension"],
    custom_lyrics_outro="Outro lyrics here"
)
print("Complete song sequence generated and downloaded:", complete_song_sequence)
```

#### Parameters

- **`auth_token`** *(Required)*: The authorization token you obtained from Udio, which is necessary for authenticating and making API requests.


Each method in the `UdioWrapper` class can take several parameters to control song generation and processing. Below is a breakdown of the parameters and their usage:

- **prompt** *(str)*: A text prompt describing the theme or emotion of the song. This is the creative input from which the song generation is based.

- **seed** *(int, optional)*: A seed number to ensure the reproducibility of the song generation. Using the same seed with the same parameters will generate the same audio output. Default is `-1`, which results in random generation each time.

- **custom_lyrics** *(str, optional)*: Lyrics written by the user to be included in the song. If no lyrics are provided, the generation relies solely on the musical style implied by the prompt.

- **audio_conditioning_path** *(str, optional)*: The file path to an audio file that will serve as a base or influence for the song being generated. This is used primarily for extending songs or generating outros based on a previous song.

- **audio_conditioning_song_id** *(str, optional)*: The identifier of a previously generated song that will be used to influence the current song generation. This is necessary when creating extended songs or outros that are meant to follow a specific musical piece.

- **num_extensions** *(int, optional)*: Specifies the number of extended songs to generate in a sequence. This parameter is only used in the method that generates a complete song sequence. Default is `1`.

- **extend_prompts** *(list of str, optional)*: A list of prompts for generating each extension in a sequence. Each prompt should ideally reflect a progression or variation in style or theme from the previous song.

- **outro_prompt** *(str, optional)*: A prompt specifically for generating an outro. This should convey a sense of conclusion or finale relative to the musical sequence.


These parameters allow full customization of the music generation process, from the initial creation through extensions to the final outro, giving users the ability to tailor both the music and lyrics to fit their specific needs or artistic vision.

### Branch Martin Updates by https://github.com/TintinSDev

- Implemented pickachu's twocapthca code to solve 500 server error on gen-proxy
- Added logging, retries and delay for detailed error info on url requests

``` import logging 
    def make_request(self, url, method, data=None, headers=None, retries=3, delay=2):
        {* Rest of code *}
            for attempt in range(retries):
                print(f"Attempt {attempt + 1}/{retries}")
                if method == 'POST':
                    captcha_solution = self.solve_captcha()
                    if captcha_solution:
                        headers["H-Captcha-Token"] = captcha_solution
                    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
                else:
                    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
                if response.status_code == 500:
                        print(f"500 Server Error: Retrying {attempt + 1}/{retries}")
                        time.sleep(delay)
                else:
                        response.raise_for_status()
                        return response

            print(f"Error making {method} request to {url}: {response.text}")
            return None
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            logging.error(f"Error making {method} request to {url}: {e}", exc_info=True) #Error making logger
            return None
```
- Implemented twocapthca api_key purchased and paid. auth_token to be generated by user
 ```   
     auth_token = "your_api_key_here" #add yout api key generated from cookies as per README instructions
     twocaptcha_api_key = "e565f9c19a3eccd58ebc8ee4a32eccc3"
     udio_wrapper = UdioWrapper(auth_token, twocaptcha_api_key)
     response = udio_wrapper.make_request("https://www.udio.com/api/generate-proxy", "POST")
     if response:
         print(response.json())
 ```
- Installed and applied nginx a high performance web server and a reverse proxy server for the generate-proxy error
  To access the nginx config file use the following command;

  ```sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    ```
  The following configuration will be displayed; where the proxy redirects to pyproxy.com
```
    server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    location /api/generate-proxy {
        proxy_pass https://www.pyproxy.com/;

        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization";

        # Added to follow redirects
        proxy_intercept_errors on;
        error_page 301 302 307 = @handle_redirects;
    }

    location @handle_redirects {
        set $saved_redirect_location '$upstream_http_location';
        proxy_pass $saved_redirect_location;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

```
- Make sure to restart the nginx server and also check status server

```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```
- Check Nginx Logs for proxy related errors
```
    sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
